# ESP32_GSM_GPS_Tracker PCB

---
## Description:
This project is a low-power GPS and GSM-based tracker built using an ESP32-S3 microcontroller and a Quectel EC200U GSM module. It allows real-time location tracking and data communication over cellular networks. The system is designed with integrated power regulation, USB Type-C programming interface, and SIM card support. Antennas for GNSS, BT/WiFi scan, and GSM enhance connectivity and GPS accuracy.
